              Entrepreneurship Cell at SIR MVIT believes that entrepreneurship is not just about starting
                companies, but a pathway towards India socio-economic development. Our vision is to make students and
                faculty entrepreneurial in every work that they do. We hope to enable them to solve global challenges as
                we see students as the greatest capital and intend to nurture them, provide them with opportunities for
                excellence.<br>E-Cell aims to unlock students latent inventive potential. Not only do we show you the
                doors of opportunity but we also equip you to walk through it. Through our conference, social events,
                lectures, speaker engagements and workshops, we're hoping to bring together everyone interested in the
                startup world and to help students best utilize resources to found or join startups..
